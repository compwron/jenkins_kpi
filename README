to get pipeline duration:
ruby src/print_pipeline_duration.rb <url of first job in pipeline>

example:
ruby src/print_pipeline_duration.rb http://localhost:8080/job/job1.in.pipeline/
0.028

This mini-app only calculates how long the latest build took to go through the pipeline
And doesn't actually know how to follow a build, just grabs the latest build time for each job in the pipeline

to run tests: 
ruby test/units/test_pipeline_duration.rb
